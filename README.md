# LocalPro

LocalPro is a local-first research computing orchestrator: plan complex tasks, run them through local compute backends, and track progress in a live web UI.

## How it works for research computing
- Plan: a planner turns a research question into a step plan with acceptance criteria.
- Execute: an executor schedules steps across available backends while honoring resource headroom.
- Evidence: outputs, citations, and artifacts are stored in SQLite and surfaced in the UI.
- Iterate: verification can trigger replans when evidence is thin or conflicting.

## Quick start (Windows)
1) Install Python 3.10+.
2) Start your local backend runtime (LM Studio by default) with a model loaded.
3) Run:
```powershell
.\start.ps1
```
4) Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000
Stop: Ctrl+C in the same window.

Optional flags:
```powershell
.\start.ps1 -Reload
.\start.ps1 -ForcePort
```

## Configuration
- `.env` is the canonical config and is safe to commit. Edit it to override host/port, backend URLs, and optional web search keys.
- `config.json` is generated by the UI at runtime and is ignored by git. Env overrides win only when `LOCALPRO_ENV_OVERRIDES_CONFIG=1`.
- For LAN access, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env`.

## Developer tools
- Live run tracing: `python .\watch_run.py --help`
- Backend profiling: `python .\localpro_cli.py models profile`

## Progress updates
Working:
- Live web UI for runs, activity feed, plan view, and citations.
- PlanStore v2 scheduling with replans and artifact storage.
- PDF/image uploads and preprocessing (when backends support vision).
- Backend discovery, profiling, and autoscaling for LM Studio.
- Optional web search integration via Tavily.

Needs work:
- Additional compute backends beyond LM Studio.
- Access control / multi-user permissions.
- Cross-platform startup scripts (macOS/Linux).
- Containerized deployment and release packaging.
